    "# Challenge - Beware of Monty Hall\n",
    "\n",
    "You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the contestant's initial guess, they have a 1/3 chance of choosing the prize door and a 2/3 chance of choosing a dud. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the prize door was originally chosen(P=0.333), the host will open a dud, and only a dud will remain. Switching means a 0% chance of winning in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a dud was originally chosen(P=0.667), the host will open the other dud, and switching means a 100% chance of winning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the contestant should always switch will given a chance. If they never switch they will have a 33% chance of winning. If they always switch, they'll have a 67% chance of winning. \n",
